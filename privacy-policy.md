# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains how **CodeSkillz** (the “App”) collects, uses, and shares information.

## Information we collect

### Information you provide

- The App does not require account creation.
- If you contact us (e.g., by email), we collect the information you include in your message.

### App usage and diagnostics

We collect limited usage data to understand how the App is used and to improve it. In this codebase, this includes screen view analytics.

### Advertising-related information

The App displays ads (including rewarded ads). Depending on your device settings and choices (and, on iOS, whether you grant App Tracking Transparency permission), Ad provider may collect and process information such as device identifiers (e.g., advertising ID), IP address, approximate location derived from IP address, and ad interaction data.

### Device and app information

Our third-party providers (e.g., analytics/ads SDKs) may automatically receive information such as device model, OS version, language, app version, and IP address.

### Information stored locally

The App stores some information locally to support functionality (for example, local activity logs and app state). This data stays on your device unless you choose to share it with us.

## How we use information

- Provide and operate the App
- Measure performance and improve features
- Show ads and manage consent (where applicable)
- Comply with legal obligations

## Sharing of information

We may share information with analytics service providers and advertising providers.

## Advertising and tracking choices

### iOS (App Tracking Transparency)

On iOS, the App may request permission to allow personalized ads. If you deny permission, ads may still be shown but may be less relevant.

### Consent (EEA/UK and other regions)

If required by applicable law, the App may show an ads consent form. You can also adjust device-level ad settings.

## Data retention

We keep information only as long as necessary for the purposes described above, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. Third parties may retain information according to their own policies.

## Security

We take reasonable measures to protect information, but no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## Children’s privacy

The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Your rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, delete, or correct personal information, or object to certain processing. To request help, contact [codeskillzapp@googlegroups.com](mailto:codeskillzapp@googlegroups.com).

## Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time and will update the effective date when changes are made.
